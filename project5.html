		<h1> Computer Vision PII Removal</h1>
		<p>Team: ML Engineers and project manager <br>
		Role: Product Designer <br>
		Timeline: 2 Months <br>
		Scale: Ford internal - thousands of employees<br>
		Technology: Google Cloud Platform, Sketch, Invision <br>
		</p>
		<p>
		Problem: Experimental self-driving cars capture 360 video while on the road around the globe. Privacy legislation and civic concerns make it necessary for Ford to ensure any personally identifying information (PII) is scrubbed from videos in our archive in order for experimental teams to share data. A repository of self-driving car videos that is searchable would be useful for engineering teams, so they can use the data without privacy concerns. Additionally, concerned citizens are able to call Ford directly via a hotline listed on the self-driving cars themselves to ensure their privacy is respected. We needed a portal for engineers to share data, marketing to be able to pull down self driving car videos, and legal to ensure to citizens that their privacy was being respected.</p>

		<p>Process:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Worked with ML Engineers to diagram the model </li>
				<li> Did stakeholder research to understand how an application utilizing the model would be beneficial at Ford and to determine requirements</li>

 				<img src="flowdiagram1.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="shark robot vacum and screenshot of the shark app">
			</figure>
		
			<ul>
				<li> Conducted user interviews to better understand how an engineering user, legal user, and customer liability user would all be able to leverage the platform</li>				
				<li> Determined requirements for an MVP application to serve engineering users with a research plan and backlog to expand the platform to all PII video masking needs at Ford</li>
				<li> Created initial wireframes for an interface that would eventually serve the needs of all three user groups</li>
	</ul>

<p>Outcome: The application was developed to legal specifications and the potential for the model's capabilities was introduced across working groups at Ford. Automated PII removal from video and a repository of privacy protected videos was incredibly valuable across the company as the self-driving car organization is global. </p>

I also included the content workflow in the design styleguide to keep design in the loop once I passed the project off.
