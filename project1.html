		<h2> Internal Data Portal Homepage </h2>
		<p>Team: Project manager, business stakeholders, ML engineers Role: Product Designer Timeline: 8 weeks, design engaged 25 hours a week on average (I was working on 2 other projects in tandem) Summer 2021 Scale: The data organization within Ford, a few thousand people Technology: Informatica data catalog, Angular</p>
		<p>Problem: A data catalog tool was meant to democratize data for the global data organization team, but the only entry point was a basic search-bar based interface, which wasn’t useful as robust metadata hadn’t been added yet, making search ineffective. We needed another way to navigate users to the data they needed to get to quickly and easily. </p>
		<p> Process </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Worked with a tech anchor to gain a technical landscape analysis</li>
			<li>Did longform interviews with both users and stakeholders.</li>
			<li>Observed users in their current search workflow</li>
			<li>Created a product roadmap for a homepage navigation interface and help documentation portal</li>
			<li>Designed a UI and content strategy</li>
			<li>Ensured a dynamic design for multiple versions of the page that could be implemented based on data security group</li>
			<li>Onboarded the data catologue team to the rally/excel based content management system and closed the project</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Outcome: Despite many technical roadblocks, the project was completed successfully, as a flexible link-based homepage and help documentation that would function as navigation outside of a search bar. Additionally, a paralel strategy for metadata contenting within the catalog itself, that would feed into the homepage, was implemented. We received a 5/5 CSAT score from the client team and the portal has seen user growth. </p>

		<h2>Ford, Google Cloud Platform Hackathon</h2>
		<p>Project: Ford Google Cloud Platform Hackathon, Chatbot Idea Team 1: Myself, an engineering manager, and 4 engineers Role: Product, VUI Designer Timeline: 8 hours, Summer 2021 Scale: Hypothetical exercise, if implemented all Ford drivers
		</p>
		<p> Idea: Use GCP Google Assistant integration to create a chatbot to talk to the driver in Ford vehicles.  Problem: Users get bored while driving. The entertainment console in vehicles have voice commands, but they lack the robustness of a cloud-connected virtual assistant. 
		</p>
		<p> Process </p>
		<ul>
		<li>Created simple example personas to generate usescases from using assumptions derived from consumer-facing materials and internal Ford branding documents. Used these users to frame our problem statement. </li>
		<li>Generated usecases based on general user expectations of virtual assistants, design trends around them, and how the Virtual Assistant would interact with the car, providing value 		to the customer and enhancing the driving experience. </li>
		<li>Drafted converstional scripts for the personas based on usecase brainstorm </li>
		<li>Created a simple VUI diagram for one of the scripts.</li>
		<li>Worked with developers to ship one intent and presented our findings to a panel of judges.</li>
</ul>
		<p>Outcome: Despite many technical roadblocks, the project was completed successfully, as a flexible link-based homepage and help documentation that would function as navigation outside of a search bar. Additionally, a paralel strategy for metadata contenting within the catalog itself, that would feed into the homepage, was implemented.
